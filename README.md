# Problem to solve
 - [ ] [Front] : change `BirthDate` format to **Date** without **Time**,<br>
 *Actually it's bizzare to show birthdate with time like `3 Aug 1982 - 05:42:13` as well, right?*
 - [ ] [Both] : add **basic system**
 - [ ] [Both] : add **login system**

*[Both] : it's a both (Front&Back - end)'s work/problem, as same with [Front] and [Back]*
